     Practice Question:
     Square a Number.
     Write a program that squares an integer and prints the result.

     Your program should read lines from standard input. Each line will contain a positive integer.

     25

 Predict the Number
 Description:
 The example sequence 011212201220200112 â€¦ is constructed as follows:
 1. The first element in the sequence is 0.
 2. For each iteration, repeat the following action: take a copy of the entire current sequence, replace 0 with 1, 1 with 2, and 2 with 0, and place it at the end of the current sequence.
 E.g. 001011201121220

 Create an algorithm which determines what number is at the Nth position in the sequence (using 0-based indexing).

 Input: Your program should read lines from standard input.
 Each line contains an integer N such that 0 <= N <= 3000000000.

 Output: Print out the number which is at the Nth position in the sequence.

 Test Case 1
 Input: N = 0
 Explanation: The sequence starts with 0, so the 0th element is 0.
 Expected Output: 0

 Test Case 2
 Input: N = 3
 Explanation: The sequence up to the 3rd position is 0 -> 01 -> 0112 -> 01121220. The element at the 3rd position is 2.
 Expected Output: 2

 Test Case 3
 Input: N = 10
 Explanation: The sequence continues to expand as 0 -> 01 -> 0112 -> 01121220 -> 0112122012202001 -> .... Following this expansion, we find that the 10th element in the sequence is 2.
 Expected Output: 2

// This function finds the number at the given position in the sequence.
func predictNumber(at position: Int) -> Int {
    // Base case: If the position is 0, return 0 as it's the start of the sequence.
    if position == 0 { return 0 }

    // Initialize variables:
    // - `currentPosition` to track which position we're currently evaluating.
    // - `numberForPosition` to hold the number at the current position, starting with 0.
    var currentPosition = position
    var numberForPosition = 0

    // Continue until we've traced back to the start of the sequence (position 0).
    while currentPosition > 0 {
        // Find the largest power of 2 that is less than or equal to `currentPosition`.
        // This represents the size of the current iteration's block.
        var powerOfTwo = 1
        // Loop to find the next power of 2
        while powerOfTwo <= currentPosition {
            powerOfTwo *= 2
        }
        // Adjust back to the correct power of 2 since we went one step too far
        powerOfTwo /= 2

        // Calculate the position within the current block.
        // If `currentPosition` was in the second half of the block, this will be positive.
        let positionInBlock = currentPosition - powerOfTwo

        // Apply the transformation rule: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 0.
        // Since we're tracing back, we increment and wrap around with modulo 3.
        numberForPosition = (numberForPosition + 1) % 3

        // Move to the next position to evaluate, which is the start of the block we just evaluated.
        currentPosition = positionInBlock
    }

    // Return the calculated number at the original position.
    return numberForPosition

// Function to handle input and output, reads from the standard input.

            // If successful and non-negative, print the result of predictNumber for position n
            print("The number at position \(n) is: \(predictNumber(at: n))")
        } else {
            // If input isn't valid or negative, inform the user
            print("Please enter a valid number.")
        }

/*
Time Complexity:
O(log n): Where n is the position we're evaluating. Here's why:
The outer while loop runs until currentPosition becomes 0, which takes log2(n) steps because each iteration halves the effective range of positions we're looking at.
Inside this loop, we're finding the largest power of 2, which is essentially a binary search, also taking log2(n) time.

Space Complexity:
    O(1): The space complexity is constant because:
    We only use a fixed amount of additional memory to store currentPosition, numberForPosition, and powerOfTwo, regardless of the input size. No data structures grow with the input size.

Explanation of Complexity:
    Time Complexity:
    The function reduces the problem size by half in each iteration of the outer loop (by finding the next largest power of 2), which is characteristic of log-time algorithms. The inner loop that finds the power of 2 also operates in logarithmic time, but since it's part of each iteration of the outer loop, it doesn't increase the overall time complexity beyond log(n).

    Space Complexity:
    The function uses a constant amount of extra space for variables, regardless of how large position is. Therefore, it has a linear space complexity with respect to the problem size, but in terms of growth, it's constant.*/
