     Predict the Number
     Description:
     The example sequence 011212201220200112 â€¦ is constructed as follows:
     1. The first element in the sequence is 0.
     2. For each iteration, repeat the following action: take a copy of the entire current sequence, replace 0 with 1, 1 with 2, and 2 with 0, and place it at the end of the current sequence.
     E.g. 001011201121220

     Create an algorithm which determines what number is at the Nth position in the sequence (using 0-based indexing).

     Input: Your program should read lines from standard input.
     Each line contains an integer N such that 0 <= N <= 3000000000.

     Output: Print out the number which is at the Nth position in the sequence.

     Test Case 1
     Input: N = 0
     Explanation: The sequence starts with 0, so the 0th element is 0.
     Expected Output: 0

     Test Case 2
     Input: N = 3
     Explanation: The sequence up to the 3rd position is 0 -> 01 -> 0112 -> 01121220. The element at the 3rd position is 2.
     Expected Output: 2

     Test Case 3
     Input: N = 10
     Explanation: The sequence continues to expand as 0 -> 01 -> 0112 -> 01121220 -> 0112122012202001 -> .... Following this expansion, we find that the 10th element in the sequence is 2.
     Expected Output: 2
